## Real world example

1. **Make it Obvious**  
   **Cue:** Place a book on your nightstand or in a visible spot where you relax.  
   **Environment:** Create a cozy reading nook with good lighting and a comfortable chair.
2. **Make it Attractive**  
   **Temptation Bundling:** Pair reading with something you enjoy, like having a cup of your favorite tea or coffee.  
   **Social Aspect:** Join a book club or follow book-related social media accounts to stay motivated and get recommendations.
3. **Make it Easy**:  
   **Start Small:** Begin with just 5-10 minutes of reading each day. Gradually increase the time as the habit becomes more ingrained.  
   **Reduce Friction:** Choose books that genuinely interest you and are easy to access, whether physical copies, e-books, or audiobooks.
4. **Make it Satisfying**:  
   **Immediate Reward:** Treat yourself to a small reward after completing a reading session, like a piece of chocolate or a short walk.  
   **Track Progress:** Use a reading tracker or app to log the books you read and see your progress over time.
