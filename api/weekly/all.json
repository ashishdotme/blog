I created a separate repository for my blog content on <a href=\"https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. I installed Obsidian and several <a href=\"https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog/tree/master/.obsidian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> to assist me in writing blogs in markdown with ease. Additionally, I have successfully set up a pipeline using GitHub actions to convert my markdown files into HTML content.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cococolanosugar/mdbook-auto-gen-summary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mdbook Auto Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jamiehurst.co.uk/2023-09-17_pkm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Hurst's Blog - PKM: How I Organise Myself</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heymichellemac.com/obsidian-setup-sep-2021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Walkthrough Of My Obsidian Setup | heymichellemac</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "content": "<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<p>This week, I have added numerous new features in the revamped edition of my website. I have added a <code>expenses</code> page to track my personal spending, tidied up the week notes section, and included a small widget on the homepage to showcase the most recent blog post and week note. Also added a <code>uses</code> page to monitor all the apps and electronics I utilize, along with a <code>todos</code> page to manage my public tasks. My focus for next week will be to create pages for organizing my collection of movies, TV shows, and books. I also require a sitemap page to list all the links to my website's pages.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548670/images/blog/ibbjlanyn5uzehqzibmc.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548693/images/blog/ozgzohspsuazejjqsyzm.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548719/images/blog/gpwfagot8zw6zd0zvxlr.png\" alt=\"\">\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.aiursoft.cn/anduin/sleepagent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anduin Xue / SleepAgent · GitLab</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kud/ai-prompts/blob/main/dist/espanso/index.yml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ai-prompts/dist/espanso/index.yml at main · kud/ai-prompts · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "content": "<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<p>I recently received my first smart ring, the <a href=\"https://www.amazfit.com/products/amazfit-helio-ring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazfit Helios</a>, and I have been blown away by its features and convenience. If you're like me, you may have had some experience with smartwatches before, but found the constant charging to be a hassle. That's where smart rings come in - with longer battery life and the ability to track your health data, they are a game changer in the world of wearables.</p>\n<p>I used an auto-export health app to set up automation to send steps count data and sleep analysis data every day to my server. I also set up Overland app to send battery and location data. Using this data, I updated the \"About Me\" section of my website.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1731198316/images/blog/fbddvmlexuv0dnull5em.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>Other things I did include adding all social links on my website and adding a weekly notes widget to the home page. I plan to strictly write weekly notes every week and be consistent.</p>\n<h2>Interesting Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub - tfeldmann/organize: The file management automation tool.</a></li>\n</ul>",
