I created a separate repository for my blog content on <a href=\"https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. I installed Obsidian and several <a href=\"https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog/tree/master/.obsidian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> to assist me in writing blogs in markdown with ease. Additionally, I have successfully set up a pipeline using GitHub actions to convert my markdown files into HTML content.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cococolanosugar/mdbook-auto-gen-summary\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mdbook Auto Summary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jamiehurst.co.uk/2023-09-17_pkm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jamie Hurst's Blog - PKM: How I Organise Myself</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heymichellemac.com/obsidian-setup-sep-2021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Walkthrough Of My Obsidian Setup | heymichellemac</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "content": "<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<p>This week, I have added numerous new features in the revamped edition of my website. I have added a <code>expenses</code> page to track my personal spending, tidied up the week notes section, and included a small widget on the homepage to showcase the most recent blog post and week note. Also added a <code>uses</code> page to monitor all the apps and electronics I utilize, along with a <code>todos</code> page to manage my public tasks. My focus for next week will be to create pages for organizing my collection of movies, TV shows, and books. I also require a sitemap page to list all the links to my website's pages.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548670/images/blog/ibbjlanyn5uzehqzibmc.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548693/images/blog/ozgzohspsuazejjqsyzm.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1729548719/images/blog/gpwfagot8zw6zd0zvxlr.png\" alt=\"\">\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.aiursoft.cn/anduin/sleepagent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anduin Xue / SleepAgent · GitLab</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kud/ai-prompts/blob/main/dist/espanso/index.yml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ai-prompts/dist/espanso/index.yml at main · kud/ai-prompts · GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>",

If you're like me, you may have had some experience with smartwatches before, but found the constant charging to be a hassle. That's where smart rings come in - with longer battery life and the ability to track your health data, they are a game changer in the world of wearables.</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Health Auto Export</a> app to set up automation to send steps count data and sleep analysis data every day to my server. I also set up Overland app to send battery and location data.

    "content": "<h2>Reflections</h2>\n<p>As software engineers, we're constantly learning and accumulating knowledge. But have you ever found yourself searching for a note you took months ago, only to realize it's buried in a sea of digital clutter? A personal wiki can be a game-changer in organizing your thoughts, notes, and expertise. This week, I set up a <a href=\"https://wiki.ashish.me/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">personal wiki</a> using mdbook, which generates the wiki from markdown files. I added custom CSS and JavaScript to enhance the look and feel. I'm pleased with the result and plan to use it for my detailed notes and knowledge base. To simplify the process, I used the mdbook-autosummary plugin to auto-generate the summary file needed for mdbook to generate the website. Next, I will focus on improving the wiki's homepage.</p>\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1731336834/images/blog/j4bns5sqfc4n4lupj8ds.png\" alt=\"\">\n<h2>Interesting Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub - rust-lang/mdBook: Create book from markdown files.
