    "content": "<p>I have been working on redesigning my website from scratch. My current website was created in 2018 and uses many deprecated libraries, so I decided it was time for a fresh start.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/ashishdotme/image/upload/f_auto/v1728745168/images/blog/dfjcojfepa70ryihglpt.png\" alt=\"\">\nMy old website</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the website, I am also working on building a dashboard to collect all of my data. I have already stored a lot of my data in a database and have even built a small frontend for it. Currently, I have stored information on movies I have watched, shows I have watched, courses I have completed, and books I have read. However, I plan to expand this database to include my notes, songs I have listened to, bookmarks, steps count, YouTube likes, and even my status updates.</p>\n<p>I have plans to write more. I am planning on adding a weekly updates section to my website. I have already created templates for blog posts, weekly updates, and a \"now\" page for Obsidian.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog/tree/master/scripts/obsidian-templates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Templates</a></p>\n<p>That's not all - I also have plans to create a photography website to store all of my travel photos. Next year, I am planning to travel to the UK and I want to have a dedicated platform to showcase all of my amazing photos.</p>\n<p>List of things I am looking to build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new website using Next.js/Remix/NuxtJs.</li>\n<li>A personal CLI using Deno.</li>\n<li>A personal mobile app for manual data entry.</li>\n<li>An Obsidian workflow setup for blog post, weekly updates.</li>\n</ul>",
