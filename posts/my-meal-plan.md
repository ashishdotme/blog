This year, I made a commitment to prioritize my health and fitness. After researching various approaches, I decided to implement intermittent fasting alongside a structured diet plan focused on balanced nutrition.

## Schedule

My eating window runs from 12 PM to 7:30 PM, giving my body a 16.5-hour fasting period each day.

## Diet

Below meal includes optimal amounts of protein, complex carbohydrates, vegetables, and healthy fats:

**Lunch (12 PM)**

- 1.5 cups dal/paneer/tofu/chicken (200gm) or 4 egg omelets 
- 1 cup salad
- 1 small bowl of curd

**Evening Snack (5 PM)**

- 10 almonds and 5 walnuts
- 1 glass whey protein shake with 1 banana

**Dinner (8-9 PM)**

- 150-200g grilled vegetable curry/lentils
- 1 small bowl rice or 2 roti

Also I make sure to drink at least 3 liters of water throughout the day to stay well-hydrated and eat multivitamin everyday.
