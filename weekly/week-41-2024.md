# Reflections

Last week was incredibly productive. I dedicated my time to tidying up my website. I created a separate repository for my blog content on [GitHub](https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog). I installed Obsidian and several [plugins](https://github.com/ashishdotme/blog/tree/master/.obsidian) to assist me in writing blogs in markdown with ease. Additionally, I have successfully set up a pipeline using GitHub actions to convert my markdown files into HTML content.
