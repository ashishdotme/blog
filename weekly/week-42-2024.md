## Reflections

This week, I have added numerous new features in the revamped edition of my website. I have added an `expenses` page to track my personal spending, tidied up the week notes section, and included a small widget on the homepage to showcase the most recent blog post and week note. Also added a `uses` page to monitor all the apps and electronics I utilize, along with a `todos` page to manage my public tasks. My focus for next week will be to create pages for organizing my collection of movies, TV shows, and books. I also require a sitemap page to list all the links to my website's pages.
