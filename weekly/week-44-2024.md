## Reflections

As software engineers, we're constantly learning and accumulating knowledge. But have you ever found yourself searching for a note you took months ago, only to realize it's buried in a sea of digital clutter? A personal wiki can be a game-changer in organizing your thoughts, notes, and expertise. This week, I set up a [personal wiki](https://wiki.ashish.me/) using mdbook, which generates the wiki from markdown files. I added custom CSS and JavaScript to enhance the look and feel. I'm pleased with the result and plan to use it for my detailed notes and knowledge base. To simplify the process, I used the mdbook-autosummary plugin to auto-generate the summary file needed for mdbook to generate the website. Next, I will focus on improving the wiki's homepage.
