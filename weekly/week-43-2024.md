## Reflections

I recently received my first smart ring, the [Amazfit Helios](https://www.amazfit.com/products/amazfit-helio-ring), and I have been blown away by its features and convenience. If you're like me, you may have had some experience with smartwatches before, but found the constant charging to be a hassle. That's where smart rings come in - with longer battery life and the ability to track your health data, they are a game changer in the world of wearables.

I used [Health Auto Export](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069) app to set up automation to send steps count data and sleep analysis data every day to my server. I also set up Overland app to send battery and location data. Using this data, I updated the "About Me" section of my website.

Other things I did include adding all social links on my website and adding a weekly notes widget to the home page. I plan to strictly write weekly notes every week and be consistent.
