I have been working on redesigning my website from scratch. My current website was created in 2018 and uses many deprecated libraries, so I decided it was time for a fresh start.

>My old website


In addition to the website, I am also working on building a dashboard to collect all of my data. I have already stored a lot of my data in a database and have even built a small frontend for it. Currently, I have stored information on movies I have watched, shows I have watched, courses I have completed, and books I have read. However, I plan to expand this database to include my notes, songs I have listened to, bookmarks, steps count, YouTube likes, and even my status updates.

I have plans to write more. I am planning on adding a weekly updates section to my website. I have already created templates for blog posts, weekly updates, and a "now" page for Obsidian.

That's not all - I also have plans to create a photography website to store all of my travel photos. Next year, I am planning to travel to the UK and I want to have a dedicated platform to showcase all of my amazing photos.

List of things I am looking to build:

- A new website using Next.js/Remix/NuxtJs.
- A personal CLI using Deno.
- A personal mobile app for manual data entry.
- An Obsidian workflow setup for blog post, weekly updates.
